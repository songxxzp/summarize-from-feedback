It may sound like the plot of a Disney movie - but Todd the fox really does think he's a dog.

The animal was tamed after being rescued as a four-month-old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner Emma D'Sylva.

Since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging, playing with toys and even walking on a lead.

Scroll down for video

Beloved pet: Emma D'Sylva and Todd the fox, who she rescued as a cub and raised as a domestic pet

The 11-month-old animal accompanies Ms D'Sylva's pet labradors Sky and Oakley on walks, drawing double-takes from other dog-walkers when they see Todd trotting through the local park.

He also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden, plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it's feeding time.

Emma, 25, from Stanfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., said: 'Todd has been captive-bred so he has never been in the wild.

'I've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners couldn't look after him any more.

Canine customs: Todd enjoys going on walks, playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he's happy

Sleeps in a kennel: The 11-month-old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets

'I get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him.

'He was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead.

'He is very playful with me. He will run up to me wagging his tail when I go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled.

'He will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside.

'We got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed.

'He is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive. He gets on with my two dogs, and wants to play with them all the time.

Playful: The fox, pictured in the park with Ms D'Sylva, cannot be let off the lead because he is deaf

School visits: Ms D'Sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them, including Todd, into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them

'He tries to do what the dogs do but I can't let him off the lead because he's deaf so I can't shout him to come back.

'At first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now.

'If people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently.'

Todd also lives with Emma's menagerie of other creatures at her three-bedroomed house including a skunk, a raccoon, lizards and snakes.

She takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive-bred animals.

Emma, who lives with her partner Steve Johnson, 34, added: 'Todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms.

Walking companions: Todd is pictured in the woods with Ms D'Sylva's two labradors Sky and Oakley

'He's really getting used to things now and I'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him.'

An RSPCA spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in England and Wales as long as they were treated well.

He added: 'Foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild.

'Anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.'

Steve Bruce has brought an end to the uncertainty surrounding his future at Hull City after agreeing a new three-year deal.

The Tigers boss was previously on a rolling 12-month contract at the KC Stadium - meaning he always had one year to run â€“ but he will now put pen to paper on a long-term extension.

Bruce had been linked with the recent vacancies at Newcastle and Fulham.

Steve Bruce has agreed a new contract at Hull City which will be signed in the next 24 hours

Bruce's side are 15th in the Premier League standings, five points clear of the relegation zone

Bruce (centre) took Hull to the FA Cup final last season, where they lost 3-2 to Arsenal

Indeed, Sportsmail understands the former Manchester United defender was interested in the position at St James' Park, while he was sounded out by Niall Quinn regarding the post at Craven Cottage.

Bruce, though, has chosen to remain on Humberside.

He said: 'We have achieved a lot in the few years we have been here but this is just the beginning of the journey.

Hull City supporters show their faith in manager Bruce for their last home game against Sunderland

Hull drew that game 1-1 with Dame N'Doye (right) scoring for Bruce's side

Bruce revealed that he has plenty of other aims that he wants to achieve in his time at Hull

'Premier League survival is now crucial for us at this time, as is improving our training facility as we look to continue to grow and become a solid, well-run Premier League club.'

Bruce took charge of Hull in the summer of 2012 and won promotion to the top-flight in his first season.

They survived and made it to the final of the FA Cup last time around and are currently five points clear of the relegation zone.

No parent wants to hear that their child is a bully - and thanks to the stiff punishment he dreamed up, this father is unlikely to hear it twice.

Timothy Robenhorst, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, was shocked to find out his son Kayden had been mistreating a classmate, and in response gave him a tough workout, gardening duty and instructions to apologize.

For the physically grueling stages of his 5-part punishment, Kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push-ups on his fists.

Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him

Next, the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher, incline push-ups, then running a mile. Early-morning Wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing.

But Kayden's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time.

Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs

But the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with Kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after, which was set to happen Wednesday.

Robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment, and encouraged people to share it. As of Friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times.

He also seemingly insisted that it be posted on Kayden's profile too, where it was set as his profile picture and cover photo.

Under the post, Robenhorst wrote: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it.

'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully!

'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere! Nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution!'

Apology: Kayden was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at Pulaski Middle School, pictured

So I'm a junior in high school. He's a senior. We've been friends this entire year and he's liked me from the beginning except for I was in a long term relationship. That ended it January and we started to have a thing in April. I was so happy with him but I was so hung up on my previous boyfriend and wanted something exactly like him so I was very distant.
I guess he considered us to be dating while I was not on the same page because I was uncomfortable and unsure of what I wanted. Lack of communication. I had no idea he thought that.
My friends also ended up playing a part. They didn't like him a whole lot because he didn't ""fit in"" and wasn't like my ex. So I had another friend that came to a party of mine. They kept pushing me and pushing me to give this guy a chance and I didn't really give in but I wasn't backing off his advances, which was wrong of me. I sat on his lap while playing super smash bros. That was really it. I thought I liked this new kid because he was like my ex. So in the midst of a mental breakdown a few days later, I ended it and went to the new guy. My ""boyfriend?"" heard that I sat on his lap so he wasn't happy. I quickly realized a few days later that I made the wrong decision and was chasing my ex through a different person.
I don't know what to do. I've thought on it for a long time and realized I'm not going to find someone like my ex and nor should I. The first guy and I were wonderful together. We still talk and have class together but it's not the same and he's still sour. I don't know how to reconcile with him without coming on so strong and sounding like an idiot. I went to him a few weeks after everything and apologized and admitted how stupid I was and that I still have feelings for him and all he said was ""cool.""

Started dating in college and brokeup right before she graduated in May (I graduated last year). It was kind of an odd breakup; things hadn't been right for a couple of months as I transitioned into the real world and she was still in school. We're from the same hometown and I'm back living at home (#StudentLoanProbs) so even though things were rocky while she was at school I had faith they'd get better once she came home (she too found a job in the area and would be living at home). For whatever reason she didn't have the same faith I did and wanted to breakup the week before she graduated and came home. I thought that was odd and kind of nonsensical, but chalked it up to the stress of graduating. Not really the point of this post.
It was my first real relationship meaning my first real breakup, so it's been a rough time for me and I'm not entirely sure how to properly handle it. The time apart has been necessary for us both and I admit I needed it, but part of me is still in love with her. We've been apart for two months now - which doesn't sound long but has seemed like forever - and I guess right now I want to get a feel for how she feels. Part of me thinks this is just "taking a break" and I've left a part of my heart with her, so I guess I want to gauge where her head is at. Plus I kinda just wanna see how she's doing. She was my best friend and we were a SUPER close couple, so it's been hard having that relationship end cold turkey.
Has this been enough time apart to finally talk again? Even just a half hour / hour long convo?

To some this sounds like a no-brainer, but it's been an eye opening realization to me. After having lost about 25lbs by abstaining entirely from chips (and numerous other triggers) I slowly began to incorporate them back into my life once I reached my goal weight. I've been around my goal weight (160) for about 4 years now, though I will cyclically gain and then lose anywhere from 5 to 7 lbs during the course of a year. It sounds dumb, but I've only just now realized what a big part chips-available-to-consume have played in my maintenance lifestyle. I cut chips out of the house a month ago after a 5-lb gain in 3 months, and I'm back down to 160.
 I haven't eliminated them entirely -- I still eat them in modest quantities at friend's houses if we're celebrating and the like -- but it's almost liberating to realize how much they affected my body, and to make a life decision based on that.
I can't have chips in the house. Done. Bring on the world!

I found that the graph seemed fairly simplistic  then I used a curve fit through some coding and trial and error using a matlab file that I wrote up I found that the curve was never more than +-10 off from the actual value of the prime at that integer.  I tried googling this observation but can't seem to find those magical keywords to get my results.  Does anyone know if this has been researched?  I feel like this is basically a pattern of primes; knowing that if you find the equation to this curve and plug in any integer the value you get will be +-10 units from a prime number. Any thoughts?

So my boyfriend of 6 months and I decided that it will be great to go on a cruise. Now on some level I always knew that my brother will say no but I thought let's try. I told him and predictably he said no. He explained that not having access to me for a week, being on the water for the first time, and being around drinks and alcohol (I shouldn't drink, messes up my treatment) is risky and I shouldn't go. He said it's fine if we want to take a different holiday on land somewhere that's easy to access but he won't allow me to go to a cruise ship.
Ok I was disappointed but I kind of knew he won't allow it. My boyfriend was really frustrated when I told him. He said he really looked forward to this trip and he doesn't want to cancel, he thinks we should still go and my brother can't stop us. He also said my brother is very controlling and he's acting like a parent and he's being an asshole to me for not letting me do what I want to do and he's a abusing his role as guardian. Look I'm disappointed too but I think we can still have fun in a different trip.
I don't know. He's really really upset about this whole thing and I don't know what to do.
